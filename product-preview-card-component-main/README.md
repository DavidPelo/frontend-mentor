## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Using the object-fit property was something new to me

```css
  .desktop-img {
    display: block;
    border-radius: 16px 0px 0px 16px;
    width: 50%;
    object-fit: cover;
  }
```

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit) - This helped me with the object-fit property when I was having trouble getting the image to look right in the desktop-view.
